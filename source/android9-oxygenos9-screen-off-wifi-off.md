# Android 9, Oxygen OS 9 WiFi Wireless Disables When Screen Off

An annoying issue I've dealt with for almost a year now is WiFi/Wireless turning itself off every time my screen 
turns off. No matter what I searched in settings and checking as many options as I could, it would always turn off. 
Finally I found this semi-hidden option (why is it two screens deeper than anything else?) and that fixed it for me

* Settings
* Battery
* Battery Optimisation
* Open the menu and select Advanced Optimisation
* Disable Sleep standby optimisation
